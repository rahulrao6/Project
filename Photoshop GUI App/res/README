PIXEL CLASS:
This class represents the pixel of an image
VARIABLES
red variable represents the red value of the pixel
green variable represents the green value of the pixel
blue variable represents the blue value of the pixel
METHODS
brighten: the purpose of this method is to brighten the pixel; this is done by adding a value to the current values of red, green, and blue
greyscale: the purpose of this method is to convert it to greyscale; this is done by
if the parameter is red, it sets the green and blue values to the red value
if the parameter is green, it sets the red and blue values to the green value
if the parameter is blue, it sets the red and green values to the blue value
if the parameter is value, it sets the red, green, and blue value to whatever the maximum is
if the parameter is intensity, it sets the red, green, and blue value to whatever the average of the three is
if the parameter is luma, it sets the red, green, and blue value to whatever 0.2126*red + 0.7152*green + 0.0722*blue is
getRed: the purpose of this method is that it returns the red value
setRed: the purpose of this method is setting the red to a new value
getGreen: the purpose of this method is to return the green value
setGreen: the purpose of this method is setting the green to a new value
getBlue: the purpose of this method is that it returns the blue value
setBlue: the purpose of this method is setting the blue to a new value

IMAGE CLASS
it represents the image
VARIABLES
width represents the width of the image
height represents the height of the image
the maxValue represents the maximum value of a pixel component
pixels represents a two-dimensional array that contains the pixel objects that make up the image

METHODS
save method creates a ppm file containing the width, the height, and the maxValue, and the red, green, and blue values of the pixels on your local computer
brighten method loops through every pixel of the image and brightens the pixel
flipVertically loops through every pixel and swaps pixels from the top to the bottom
flipHorizontally loops through every pixel and swaps pixels from the left side to right side’
greyscale loops through every pixel and calls the greyscale method on every pixel
sepia loops through every pixel and applys the filtering color transformation on every pixel
greyscale (second) loops through every pixel, compares, and assigns max value and calls the
greyscale method.
blur loops through every pixel, and applys blurring filter to every pixel
sharpen loops through every pixel and applys sharpening filter to every pixel
IMAGEPROCESSOR CLASS
represents the controller; purpose of this is to read the commands from the user and call the appropriate methods based on the users input
VARIABLES
images is a hash map of images where the name is the key and image object is the value
METHODS
loadImage loads the image from the computer and adds it to the hash map
save image gets the image from the hash map and saves the image to the computer
brighten image gets the image from the hash map and brightens that image
flipVert gets the image from the hash map and flips it vertically
flipHor gets the image from the hash map and flips it horizontally
greyscale gets the image from the hash map and converts it to greyscale
parseCommand prompts the user to enter a command and executes the appropriate method based on that command
greyscale (second) gets image from a hash map and converts to greyscale
sepiaImage gets image from a hash map and converts to sepia
blurImage gets image from a hash map and blurs that image
sharpenImage gets image from a hash map and sharpens that image
IMAGEPROCESSORVIEW CLASS
represents the textview of the program: purpose is to be able to run the program on the console
VARIABLES
- image processor is the controller

METHODS
run runs the program
readCommands gets fileName from parameter and reads the file commands

ImageProcessorGUI CLASS
represents the user interface of the program: purpose is to be able to display the user interface
to the user.
VARIABLES
- chartHeight represents the height of the chart
- filtersPanel represents the JPanel for all of the filters features
- imagePanel represents the image preview
- loadSavePanel represents the left panel on the GUI for load and save features
- chartPanel represents the histogram chart Jpanel in the bottom of the GUI
- saveFileType represents the file type
- loadButton represents the button for load
- saveButton represents the buttom for saving
- sepiaButton represents the button to make the image sepia
- greyscaleButton represents the button to make the image greyscale
- horizontalFlipButton represents the button to flip the image horizontally
- verticalFlipButton represents the button to flip the image vertically
- brightenButton represents the button to make the image brighter
- blurButton represents the button to make the image blurred
- sharpenButton represents the button to make the image sharpened
- redComponentButton represents the button to use the redComponent feature on the image.
- greenComponentButton represents the button to use the redComponent feature on the image.
- blueComponentButton represents the button to use the blueComponent feature on the image.
- valueComponentButton represents the button to use the valueComponent feature on the image.
- intensityComponentButton represents the button to use
- the intensityComponent feature on the image.
- lumaComponentButton represents the button to use the redComponent feature on the image.
- scrollPane represents the pane for scrolling
- imageLabel represents the title of the image.


METHODS:
actionPerformed performs a feature based on the ActionEvent of a user.
updateImageAndChart refreshes the image and chart in the GUI
displayImage displays the image that was loaded
displayChart displays the histogram in the GUI
drawLine displays lines for the bar of the histogram.
